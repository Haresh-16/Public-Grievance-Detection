# Public-Grievance-Detection

> This is a public grievance detection across six classes using Single Shot Detection(SSD)

> Part of the project "Grievance Register Application" which won first prize at [Daksh Smart City Hackathon](https://www.hackathon.com/event/daksh-hackathon-5e33c579bfeebd001b2de625)

> Used Single Shot Detector Keras implementation from [ssd-keras](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras)

## Dependencies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Keras API](https://keras.io/)

### Getting started

- ssd7_training.py has the code where the
  ***training*** and ***inference*** is done.

### Dataset

- Please contribute to the dataset by adding any image of the public grievance from below categories:

  ***Overflowing garbage***

  ***Patchy roads***
  
  [![Patchy roads](https://github.com/Haresh-16/Public-Grievance-Detection/blob/master/train/patchy%20(53).jpg)]()
  
  ***Open manhole***

  ***Proper manhole***

  ***Proper garbage bin***
  
  [![Proper garbage bin](https://github.com/Haresh-16/Public-Grievance-Detection/blob/master/train/prop_road43.jpg)]()
  
  ***Proper road***
  
  [![Proper road](https://github.com/Haresh-16/Public-Grievance-Detection/blob/master/train/roads%20(11).jpg)]()
  
- The Proper manhole , Proper garbage bin and Proper roads are examples of proper facilities which will be helpful for authorities
  automatic detection of a redressed issue

- You can add any image of a scene related to above categories you may encounter in your day-to-day life :)

- This will be helpful for forming a comprehensive dataset that'll help drive deep learning solutions for automatic grievance redressal
  solutions.
