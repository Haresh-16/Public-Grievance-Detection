# Public-Grievance-Detection

> This is a public grievance detection across six classes using Single Shot Detection(SSD)

> Part of the project "Grievance Register Application" which won first prize at [Daksh Smart City Hackathon](https://www.hackathon.com/event/daksh-hackathon-5e33c579bfeebd001b2de625)

> Used Single Shot Detector Keras implementation from [ssd-keras](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras)

## Dependencies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Keras API](https://keras.io/)

### Dataset

- Please contribute to the dataset by adding any image of the public grievance from below categories:

  -Overflowing garbage
  
  -Patchy roads
  
  -Open manhole
  
  -Proper manhole
  
  -Proper garbage bin
  
  -Proper road 
  
- The Proper manhole , Proper garbage bin and Proper roads are examples of proper facilities which will be helpful for authorities
  automatic detection of a redressed issue

- You can add any image of a scene related to above categories you may encounter in your day-to-day life :)

- This will be helpful for forming a comprehensive dataset that'll help drive deep learning solutions for automatic grievance redressal
  solutions.
